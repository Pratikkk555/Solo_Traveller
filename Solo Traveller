Solo Traveller

In lands unknown, I tread alone,
A solo soul on paths unshown.
With map in hand and heart aflame,
I chase the world, no two days the same.

Through bustling markets and quiet lanes,
I weave my tale with nature's reins.
The open road my constant guide,
In solitude, my spirit can't hide.

Beneath starlit skies and foreign moons,
I pen my thoughts in whispered tunes.
The solitude becomes my friend,
As on this journey, my soul I mend.

No agendas, no ties to bind,
Just the freedom of my wandering mind.
In solitude's embrace, I find my song,
A solo traveler, forever strong.

Faces and places, memories etched,
In every step, a world unmatched.
Through distant valleys and mountains high,
I spread my wings, learn to fly.

So here I am, a lone wanderer's heart,
Bound to the road, never apart.
In solo strides, I find my grace,
A nomad's journey, a timeless embrace.

Traveller Bike

On wheels of freedom, I take my flight,
A traveler's bike, my guide in the night.
Wind in my hair, road humming beneath,
Journeying far, beyond cities' wreath.

Two wheels and a frame, a trusty steed,
Carrying me through every need.
Asphalt and gravel, they're all the same,
In the realm of adventure, I stake my claim.

Through rugged terrains and open skies,
My traveler's bike, a true ally.
Pedals spinning, heart beating wild,
Every turn, a new story compiled.

Mountains conquered, valleys embraced,
With each pedal stroke, a memory traced.
Under the sun's warm and gentle kiss,
I find my solace, pure and bliss.

Campfires and stars, nights on the road,
Beneath the moon's glow, a traveler's ode.
The world unfolds in a scenic view,
And on my bike, I find life anew.

maine fork kiya aur change bhi kiya

So I ride on, with spirit unbound,
A traveler's bike, my own sweet sound.
Together we venture, two souls as one,
Through the landscapes vast, we'll never be done.
