Solo Traveller

In lands unknown, I tread alone,
A solo soul on paths unshown.
With map in hand and heart aflame,
I chase the world, no two days the same.

Through bustling markets and quiet lanes,
I weave my tale with nature's reins.
The open road my constant guide,
In solitude, my spirit can't hide.

Beneath starlit skies and foreign moons,
I pen my thoughts in whispered tunes.
The solitude becomes my friend,
As on this journey, my soul I mend.

No agendas, no ties to bind,
Just the freedom of my wandering mind.
In solitude's embrace, I find my song,
A solo traveler, forever strong.

Faces and places, memories etched,
In every step, a world unmatched.
Through distant valleys and mountains high,
I spread my wings, learn to fly.

So here I am, a lone wanderer's heart,
Bound to the road, never apart.
In solo strides, I find my grace,
A nomad's journey, a timeless embrace.
